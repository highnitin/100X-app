# 100x Blogging App

Welcome to the 100x Blogging App project! This repository is dedicated to recreating the core functionality of the popular social media platform, Twitter, under the moniker of 100x Blogging. This README file serves as your guide to the project and its development stages.

## Project Overview

The 100x Blogging App is a web application built with Tailwind CSS. The project consists of several key stages:

### üöÄ Stage 1: Buttons

In the initial stage of development, we focused on creating stylish and user-friendly buttons that define the app's aesthetics. These buttons form an integral part of the app's interface and play a crucial role in user interactions.

### üõ†Ô∏è Stage 2: Components

The second stage involves building various components that make up the 100x Blogging App's user interface. We crafted reusable and responsive components to enhance the overall user experience. These components provide the foundation for the app's structure.

### üì¶ Stage 3: Cards

The third stage of development is centered around creating cards that display content in an appealing and organized manner. These cards are designed to showcase user-generated content, adding a visually engaging element to the app.

### üé® Stage 4: Layout

In the final stage, we've focused on the overall layout and structure of the application. This stage is dedicated to arranging components, cards, and other elements to create a cohesive and intuitive user experience.
